TLS Capture Analysis
====================

Protocol: TLS (Transport Layer Security) over TCP
Port: 12347

Packet Flow:
1. TCP Connection Establishment (3-way handshake):
   - Client -> Server: SYN
   - Server -> Client: SYN-ACK
   - Client -> Server: ACK

2. TLS Handshake:
   - Client -> Server: Client Hello
   - Server -> Client: Server Hello + Certificate + Server Hello Done
   - Client -> Server: Client Key Exchange + Change Cipher Spec + Encrypted Handshake Message
   - Server -> Client: Change Cipher Spec + Encrypted Handshake Message

3. Encrypted Data Transfer:
   - All application data encrypted
   - Cannot see plaintext content in capture

4. Connection Termination:
   - TLS Close Notify
   - TCP FIN handshake

Key TLS Characteristics:
- Provides encryption, authentication, and data integrity
- Built on top of TCP
- Protects against eavesdropping and tampering
- Uses certificates for server authentication
- Higher overhead than plain TCP due to encryption

Security Features:
- Confidentiality: Data encryption
- Integrity: Message authentication codes
- Authentication: Certificate-based verification
