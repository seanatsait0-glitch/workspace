TCP Capture Analysis
====================

Protocol: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Port: 12346

Packet Flow:
1. Connection Establishment (3-way handshake):
   - Client -> Server: SYN
   - Server -> Client: SYN-ACK
   - Client -> Server: ACK

2. Data Transfer:
   - Client -> Server: Registration JSON data (PSH-ACK)
   - Server -> Client: ACK
   - Client -> Server: Login JSON data (PSH-ACK)
   - Server -> Client: ACK + Response data (PSH-ACK)
   - Client -> Server: ACK

3. Connection Termination:
   - Either side can initiate with FIN

Key TCP Characteristics:
- Connection-oriented protocol
- Reliable data delivery
- Guaranteed ordering
- Flow control and congestion control
- Higher overhead than UDP
- Suitable for persistent connections

Header Fields:
- Source Port: Client port
- Destination Port: 12346
- Sequence Number: Data ordering
- Acknowledgment Number: Expected next sequence
- Flags: SYN, ACK, PSH, FIN, RST, URG
- Window Size: Flow control
- Checksum: Error detection
